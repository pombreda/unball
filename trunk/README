Unball 0.2.10
by deitarion (Stephan Sokolow)
Version 0.2.10

Inspired by maitre's unball (http://kdelook.org/content/show.php?content=12561)
(It would be based on it, but there was none of the old code left by the time I was done the first release)

Version 1.0.0 of this script will be released when I am satisfied that the interface behaviour has stabilized and
	that the list of supported archive formats and planned features have grown/shrunk enough.
The changelog may now be found in the ChangeLog file.

==== Installation: ====

To install unball system-wide, just run `./install.sh` as root.
For details on alternate uses of install.sh, run `./install.sh --help`.

==== Usage: ====

Console:
  Just run `unball someArchive.zip` and let it do it's thing.
  For details, run `unball --help`.

KDE:
  Right-click any archive and "Extract with unball" will be available from the Actions menu.
  Right-click any folder and "Move to Zip Archive" will be available in the Actions menu.

The unit tests can be run by typing `./run_test.py` after installing unball. (preferrably not as root)

==== Tips: ====

When using Konqueror, you can easily batch-convert a collection of assorted archives to Zips:
1. Select all of the archives and choose "Extract with unball" from the Actions menu.
2. Select all of the folders which result and choose "Move to Zip Archive" from the Actions menu.
3. Once all the folders are gone, delete the original non-Zip archives.
(The folders will only vanish after the zip archives have been tested)

==== Programmer's TODO list: ====
	
Known Bugs:
- Extensionless files won't extract
- If the archive name or the name of the extracted program/folder contains spaces, then unball will always
  create a containing folder.
- unball can create empty directories in some situations
- In the case of one or more files having corrupted contents, unball refuses to extract ACE archives.
  I suspect this is a problem with a lot more formats. I'll have to write some unit tests and fix the
  problem. (The problem is that unball just aborts if the backend tool returns a nonzero exit code.)
- arj isn't being passed an "always answer yes" flag which is vital for extracting split ARJ files.
- arj won't be able to extract split ARJ files when the contents cross archive boundaries. A solution will
  require some of the same changes that fixing problems related to split RAR files requires.
- Cannot extract multi-volume archives generated by GNU tar's -M option. (Note to self: see 
  http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Using-Multiple-Tapes.html for reference)

Notes:
- MacOS X .pkg packages are actually just directories and .mpkg files are data files which aren't archives.

System Integration:
- Create and bundle a nautilus script (http://g-scripts.sourceforge.net/)
- The Konqueror script should give some kind of warning on failure.

Formats and Tools:
- Add support for zip files using bzip2 compression. (p7zip can extract them)
- Add support for using nomarch as an alternative to arc
- Unball only supports Java .war files. (renamed zips) Konqueror .war files are renamed .tgz files.
- Figure out what PC-BSD Installers (.pbi) MacOS X .dist files, .slp, and Ruby gems (.gem)  are, internally.
- Get around to adding lzma, qda, atr, sitx (Stuffit X)
- Look for a way to add support for zip archives compressed using ppmd. (Created by WinZip 10)
- Figure out whether the following programs generate something unball doesn't already unpack: freeze, pax, ppmd, upm
- Consider adding a switch which enables use of UPX decompression when applicable. (UPX is an executable packer)
- Figure out what .xef files are. (WinACE offers to handle them)
- Figure out exactly what format *.slp files use and call the decompressor directly rather than converting them to .tgz with alien.
- Figure out how to make a .bhx file (BinHex ASCII, according to filext.com) for the tests.
- Add more support for identifying disk image formats that cannot be unpacked by unball. (eg. ISO, DMG, BIN, CCD, etc.)
- Add proper split archive support (RAR, ZIP, ACE, ARJ, and what else?)
- Add unshield to the list of *.exe checks if it's capable of unpacking single-file installshield packs.
- Add support for identification (and, if possible, extraction) of .hex (BinHex 1) and .hcx (BinHex 2) files
- Look into the use of http://sourceforge.net/projects/macbinconv
- Add support for using base64tool

Unit Tests:
- Ensure that the extraction tool gets to pick the name when the archive only contains one file or folder.
- Create test files for self-extracting ARJ, LHA, and ZOO. (DosBox/DosEmu if native doesn't work)
- Make unball use stderr for error messages like it's supposed to.
- Perhaps add --silent to unball and remove the /dev/null redirect in the unit tests?
- Add unit tests for split archives (especially split ACE, split RAR using numbered extension (.r## and .###),
	split RAR using numbered suffixes (.part#.rar), split ARJ, and split tar)
- Add a check and a unit test for split ACE files where the first file (*.ACE) is uppercase and the 
	following files (*.c??) are lowercase. It freezes up unace and therefore freezes up unball.
	(I've encountered such a problem in the wild)
- Add tests for password-protected archives. (Zip, RAR, and ACE for starters)
- Implement a method of testing each program for formats which can be extracted using multiple backend tools.
	(by adjusting PATH and setting up a dir with symlinks)
- Don't forget to include unit tests in FrAT (pre-final name) to ensure that it recognizes and handles unball errors safely.
- Ensure that unball passes "Missing Extractor" errors out to the calling program as exit codes.
- Make test archives for:
  - Specialized variants of currently tested formats: .egg, .ipk
  - Un-tested self-extractors: arj, lha, sea
  - Stuff which may be difficult to create: .tar.z (apparently different from .tar.Z), .sea.bin, .sit.bin, .dms, .adf, .adz, .alz, .cab (InstallShield), .paq6, .sfark, .slp
  - Stuff which has been tested using non-redistributable (or overly large) archives: .deb, .lzx, .rpm, .sea.hqx
  - Stuff which cannot currently be supported: .sitx, .bh, .cpt, .dar, .dgc, .gca, .msi, .partimg, .rk, .sfpack, .shar, .sqx, .zz
- Test unball's behaviour when handed multiple arguments in the same run.
- Make it so that nonexistant extractors don't trigger a full-blown failure. Instead, display a list of skipped tests at the end with missing required binaries in brackets.
- Add an option to test only certain formats. (eg. for quick re-running while trying to fix a regression)

For Version 0.3.0 (next after 0.2.10):
- Make detection by header default so that Zip files with .rar extensions will extract.

Miscellaneous:
- Add optional use of the Gentoo Portage sandbox to ensure nothing gets changed outside of the target dir.
- Add support for recursively unpacking nested archives
- IDEA: Use a while loop and the -k option for the file command to allow properly robust extraction of files with ambiguous headers.
- Look into the option of doing the "move from temp" and "unpack next archive" stages simultaneously to speed
  things on systems where /tmp isn't on the same partition as $TARGET (in other words, skipping the /tmp part)
- Improve the design of the .exe extraction function.
- Fix the unball hack so it only uses /dev/random for the input if stdin has been closed.
- Try to figure out what about /dev/random unace needs so I can pass only that.
- Make call() more robust
- Add signal handlers using `trap`
- Audit the environment and the extractor manpages for variables I should be setting/unsetting
- Check to see if there are any variables I should be marking read-only.
