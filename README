Unball
by deitarion (Stephan Sokolow)
Version 0.2.99.0

Inspired by maitre's unball (http://kdelook.org/content/show.php?content=12561)
(It would be based on it, but there was none of the old code left by the time I was done the first release)

NOTE: Documentation is still catching up to the 0.3.x rewrite.

Version 1.0.0 of this script will be released when I am satisfied that the interface behaviour has stabilized
	and that the list of supported archive formats and planned features have grown/shrunk enough.
The changelog may now be found in the ChangeLog file.

==== Requirements: ====

For unball:
- A POSIX-compliant system (Linux, *BSD, MacOS X, etc.)
- Python 2.x (minimum version to be determined)
- The extraction tools for the formats you use, accessible via the PATH.

For moveToZip (additional):
- InfoZIP (The `zip` command) is non-optional.

For the unit tests:
- Python 2.3 or higher
- (optional) testoob (provides more readable output)

For the Xfce integration:
- A version of Xfce which uses Thunar as it's file manager
- Zenity (for the "Extract to..." option)

Please let me know if I've missed anything not on the list below:
- Gentoo's app-arch/unarj isn't supported because app-arch/arj is GPLed and better in every way.

==== Installation: ====

[Installation for unball 0.3.x is still being converted from install.sh to setup.py]

==== Usage: ====

Console:
  Just run `unball someArchive.zip` and let it do it's thing.
  For details, run `unball --help`.

KDE:
  Right-click any archive and "Extract with unball" will be available in the Actions menu.
  Right-click any folder and "Move to Zip Archive" will be available in the Actions menu.

GNOME:
  Right-click any archive and "Unball" will be available in the Scripts menu.
  Right-click any file or folder and "Move to ZIP" will be available in the Scripts menu.

Xfce:
  thunar-archive-plugin will offer unball (and moveToZip) as the backend for it's archive functions.

The unit tests can be run by typing `./run_test.py` after installing unball. (preferrably not as root)
For details on the options run_test.py accepts, use the --help option.

==== Tips: ====

When using Konqueror, you can easily batch-convert a collection of assorted archives to Zips:
1. Select all of the archives and choose "Extract with unball" from the Actions menu.
2. Select all of the folders which result and choose "Move to Zip Archive" from the Actions menu.
3. Once all the folders are gone, delete the original non-Zip archives.
(The folders will only vanish after the zip archives have been tested)

I haven't had a chance to check whether this works in Nautilus yet, but it should.

To convert a WinHTTrack-generated library of saved websites into zips for easy archival on CDs or DVDs:
1. CD into the folder where your library is kept
2. Run this command --> for SITE in *.whtt; do moveToZip.sh "${SITE%.whtt}"; rm -f "$SITE"; done
