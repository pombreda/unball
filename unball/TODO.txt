unball TODO:
0. unball should not create empty directories
1. Create and bundle a nautilus script (http://g-scripts.sourceforge.net/)
2. Add proper split RAR support
3. Improve the test suite
3.1. There seems to be some unfixed problems relating to single-file archives which don't include the
	name of the contained file in the archive's name.
3.2. Add tests to make sure that some kind of warning is given with the Konqueror system.
4. moveToZip.desktop and moveToZip.sh should become their own related project since they work so well
	with unball as a temporary FrAT alternative.
5. Write a simple tutorial explaining how to use Konqueror, unball, and moveToZip to efficiently do a
	manual recursive conversion similar to what FrAT does.
6. Don't forget to include unit tests to ensure that FrAT recognizes and handles unball errors safely.
7. Add unit tests for split archives (especially split ACE, split RAR using numbered extension (.r## and .###),
	split RAR using numbered suffixes (.part#.rar), and split ARJ)
8. Add a check and a unit test for split ACE files where the first file (*.ACE) is uppercase and the 
	following files (*.c??) are lowercase. It freezes up unace and therefor freezes up unball.
9. Move the rest of the TODO notes into this file.
10. Add unshield to the list of *.exe checks if it's capable of unpacking single-file installshield packs.
11. Add tests for password-protected archives. (Zip, RAR, and ACE for starters)
12. Make detection by header default so that Zip files with .rar extensions
	will extract.
