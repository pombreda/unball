Unball 0.3.0 has been completely rewritten in Python. This solves various known problems, probably some unknown ones, and the unit tests should minimize introduction of new ones.

Improvements:
- Fallback system (Full support for using alternative extractors if the preferred ones are unavailable)
- Experimental built-in extractors for Zip, Tar, BZip2, GZip, UUEncode, Base64, and BinHex.
- Proper portability (No more uncertainty because I can only test against GNU coreutils and bash)
- First step toward making unball's internals a proper Python module so other Python programs can use them directly.
- More thorough unit tests

Fixes:
- Mimetype detection is now done first and extensions only used as a fallback (fixes .war extraction among other things)
- Temporary directory is now created in the target folder to avoid the risk of needing to copy between partitions.
- Switched to using Python's internal string processing routines (Fixes elusive bug in case-sensitivity)
- Proper cleanup using try/finally so temp files don't get left laying around if you Ctrl+C
- Switched from piping /dev/urandom to unace to using an internal /bin/yes implementation
- Proper handling of subprocesses being killed by signals (eg. SIGINT/Ctrl+C)
- Support for using unzoo (Fixes zoo extraction on amd64)
